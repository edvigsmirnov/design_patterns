    Creational pattern
    Only one globally available instance

    Private constructors
    Private clone methods
    Static instance property

    Considered an anti-pattern because it introduces global state
    Should be used properly

    Used inside such patterns as:
    Dependency Injection
    Factories
    Builders
    Facades
